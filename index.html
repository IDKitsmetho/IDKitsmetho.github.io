 <h2 id="in-general" class="fourth-section">What is Alaska Like in General</h2>
 <p id="general-text" class="fourth-section">
 In Alaska there is great views <u>everywhere</u> throughout the year. It has <br><strong>nice fishing along with great hunting too!</strong> There are <em>no state taxes</em>, and<br> real estate is not so expensive. The temperature gets low in the long <br>winter with <strong><em>lots</em> of snow</strong>, and not too much sun. <em>However</em> in the summer, <br>the temperature can rise up to an average in the 80's and 90's. You can<br> get <strong>very</strong> good at snow sports, and you can spend a lot of time outdoors.<br> It is a layed back state, so life seems to move <strong>a bit slower</strong>. The flag is<br> <em>dark blue</em> with <em>eight gold stars</em> forming the <u>Big Dipper</u> and the <u>North<br> Star.</u>

 <p class="last-section">
     It was sold to America by Russia for <u>7.2 million dollars</u>. Gold was found <br>so it became a place were gold-seekers would come. In 1900 the Capitol<br> moved <strong>from Sitka to Juneau.</strong> In WW2 Alaska <em>lost two of its islands</em> and <br>had to wait a <em>year</em> before the military would get them back. It became a <br>state almost 100 years after buying it,the 49th state in 1949. Oil was <br>discovered but over <u>100 million acres</u> of land was put aside for<br><strong> preservation and protection</strong> throughout Alaska in 1980.
